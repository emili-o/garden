# The alt attribute for img tags

```html
<img src="url" alt="This is where the description goes.">
```

This attribute should contain a brief description of the image. Only use if the image conveys meaningful information to the user.

1. allows anyone using a screen-reader to experience your site in full
2. helps with SEO, since search engine's cannot parse what is contained in your images
3. gives users some information in case the images fail to load
